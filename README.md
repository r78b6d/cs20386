Application of the above topics are addressed using SPSS Statistics.
COURSE OUTCOMES
Students will have the opportunity to :
1. Import and prepare data for analysis
2. Learn the theory behind regression analysis
3. Analyze data and perform. regression analysis via statistical software (SPSS)
DELIVERY
This section of HUDM 5122 is an online course. All course materials will be delivered online and the course will not meet in person. We will utilize the Canvas site for course content, discussion, exercises and assessments. The midterm and final exams will take place online, within Canvas on October 17th and December 19th respectively from 7:00 – 9:00 pm.
